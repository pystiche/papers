\section{Conclusion}

In this replication study, a few of the basic algorithms are replicated in \gls{NST}. For this purpose, the basic operation of these methods is first introduced. Based on the differences observed between the documented and the reference implementation, the differences found are then described, followed by a discussion and analysis of their impact on the result. This is supported with examples. In addition, a solution is proposed to reduce these problems due to the lack of standardisation.
